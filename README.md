# File-Integrity-checker

As Linux operating systems are widely used in various domains, it  is crucial to ensure the integrity of system files and configuration to prevent unauthorized modifications, maintain system stability, and detect security breaches. Securing the integrity of system files has become crucial due to the rise in cybersecurity threats and potential weaknesses in Linux environments. It is aimed at enhancing the security and reliability of Linux-based systems. We will be developing a Python-based tool that uses cryptographic hashes, such as SHA-512, to guarantee the integrity of system files, and will be used to monitor and validate the integrity of important system files on Linux systems. When unauthorized changes or security threats are discovered, the tool notifies and alerts system administrators in real time. It maintains a thorough audit and forensic analysis log of all observed events and system file integrity checks.
